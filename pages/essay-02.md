## Introduction

The Labor movement in the United States is a significant aspect of the cultural revolution that occurred post industrialization. While seeking to shape the paradigm of economics and business that grew out of the late 1800’s, various labor groups appealed to workers and corporations, as well as to the government. These appeals took many forms, most visible were methods of direct action, such as strikes, to secure their various demands. This conflict did not only end with peaceful and beneficial resolutions, as the labor movement was often mired with accusations of communism and fell victim to Red Scares. There were constant fears that organized labor would destroy American society, or that they were conspiring against the nation. 

In attempting to change the economic structure of the United States, and to balance the power of businesses, various labor groups, including unions (both national and local), and various political parties (such as the Socialist and Communist parties), used their public platforms to bring awareness and attention to their causes. Labor unions focused primarily on engaging directly with businesses, striking, quitting, and engaging in discussions to achieve their goals. In response to these challenges, businesses utilized coercive and violent measures to break strikes and prevent unions, while also appealing to the government for aid. In response to this violence, laborers would bomb and destroy property, and some went as far as to try and attack their overseers and bosses. Political parties took these issues to government, challenging standing law, and presenting legal opposition to businesses and the economic structure. They ran candidates, and generated political action, passing new laws, and shifting the political climate to the left. This likewise fueled conflict, as opponents claimed conspiracies and insurgency. Particularly after the Bolshevik Revolution, a fear of communism prevented the welcoming of more progressive laws. However, these fears did not prevent changes from being made, as both major parties adopted parts of these agendas to appeal to a broader constituency. Often violent, and shaped by conflict, the labor movement propelled the adoption of many workplace standards we have today.

### 1900s

The turn of the century saw the rise of industrial capitalism in the United States. So called ‘robber barons’ accumulated wealth through the creation of monopolies in steel, oil, rail, and other industries. This accumulation of wealth was not distributed evenly, and created greater social inequality, particularly in centers of industry. 

Immigrants and racial minorities struggled to achieve the same prosperity as their bourgeoise counterparts, and many industrial workers turned to labor unions to demand better pay and safer work. There was some hope, after Theodore Roosevelt became president, that he would support the labor movement. A major strike of the era was the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902 in Pennsylvania. They went on strike seeking an 8-hour workday, recognition of the union, and better pay. Business leaders resisted these demands, and violent resistance broke out in the region. The National Guard was deployed to maintain peace[^1]. Though Roosevelt was able to achieve a mediated solution and end the strike, labor remained relatively uninfluential at the time.

### 1910s

The United States entered World War one in 1917, almost 3 years after the conflict began in 1914. Strikes were consistent across the country in the years leading up to American entry, as workers continued to press for better working conditions and pay. Wilson sought to avoid domestic conflict to present a unified front and increase the efficiency of the war effort. He collaborated with Samuel Gompers, the head of the American Federation of Labor, to guarantee that affiliated unions would not strike for the duration of the war. Gompers called on workers to “to see to it that the spirit and methods of democracy are maintained within our own country” as the US fought autocracy abroad and asserted that “labor has a further interest in the war. This war is a people's war, labor's war. The final outcome will be determined in the factories, the mills, the shops, the mines, the farms, the industries and the transportation agencies of the various countries.” [^2] This view of patience and unity was not universal, however it limited the extent of labor actions during the war years.

### 1920s

The post-war decade was a time of great social change and prosperity. More and more, the middle and working class were able to access the benefits of industrialization, acquiring electricity, running water, and automobiles. Still however, the benefits of this increased wealth were unevenly distributed. In urban areas, where there was a large immigrant population, inequalities were obvious. A greater focus was put on the quality of life and on factory and child labor. Many families required young children to work, either on the streets, in factories, or at home to make money to provide necessities.

For the labor movement, this was a time of great struggle. The end of World War One brought about a Red Scare, as Americans became increasingly paranoid that Socialists and Communists, or “Bolsheviks” were attempting to coup American institutions. This sentiment brought about a hostile response to the demands of labor, exemplified very clearly through the Battle of Blair Mountain in West Virginia. Miners in Logan County took up arms to protest their treatment by mining companies, the result of many years of abuse and disputes between the Mining Union and local companies. Miners demanded payment in dollars, rather than scrips, safe working conditions, and reasonable hours. To force a consideration and recognition of their demands, miners armed themselves and marched toward company headquarters. In response to the miner’s aggression, President Harding declared a state of emergency and sent in the US Army to break the strike.[^3] Fighting broke out in the area surrounding Blair Mountain, as “troops [sped] to the troubled land across Spruce Fork Ridge … there was continued firing along a great part of the ridge”.[^4] Roughly 10,000 miners died in the conflict, and none of the union demands were met. The miner's strike and rebelling were met with mixed feelings, as they represented an oppressed class of people in West Virginia, however they challenged the companies in the region who controlled the police, the supplies, and the livelihoods of most people in the state.

### 1930s

The Great Depression, begun in 1929 with the stock market crash, ushered in an era of economic upheaval. Unemployment skyrocketed as businesses were forced to lay off employees and shut down. A run on the banks in the early years of the depression increased hardships, as banks closed, and people lost their life savings.  

In 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president. Under his administration, labor unions received legal protections, first under the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933, “employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives”[^5] then when that was ruled illegal, under the Wagner Act in 1935, “Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection”[^6]. These two laws enabled workers to gain access to unions at a higher rate and increased the influence of the labor movement in the economic sphere.

### 1940s

FDR had introduced many policies during the Depression to alleviate economic struggles, and though modestly successful, was unable to fully recover the American economy. With the outbreak of another war in Europe in 1939 America was uniquely situated to profit from the conflict. FDR offered financial aid to the Allied Powers until Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. After the war, the Congress of Industrial Organizations launched “Operation Dixie” to organize southern “rubber, textile, furniture and clothing industries”.[^7] It followed in the ideals of the Civil War, seeking the liberation of the South from economic exploitation, calling the movement “the real Third American Revolution".[^8] In Washington D.C., Congress passed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which instituted a policy of “settlement of issues between employers and employees through the processes of conference”.[^9] This policy dramatically limited the legal power of labor unions, as they were unable to take more direct action against their employers and instead had to negotiate and compromise with companies.

### 1950s

The post war decade was a time of great prosperity. The military-industrial complex, which was developed in the second world war, was continued. The American economy expanded and dominated the global market. Once again, however, this prosperity was not spread evenly. Suburban neighborhoods grew up near cities, and only allowed white tenants. Jim Crow policies in the South hampered economic growth and development for the African American community. 
For organized labor, this decade was difficult. The Red Scare consumed the nation, and they were looked on with suspicion. The House Un-American Activities Committee pursued individuals relentlessly if they were suspected of having communist ties. “Most of the men and women who were targeted during the McCarthy era were or had been in or near the communist party, and many of them were union activists”.[^10] Attempts by the labor movement to seek redress and gain economic protections were rebuffed and denied.

### 1960s

The 60’s saw social uprising, as oppressed groups demanded equal rights in more visible ways. The living standard rose on the heels of economic prosperity, yet once again, these improvements were shared unequally, as minority groups were denied access to the benefits of prosperity. This prosperity also led to greater economic output from companies. This increased profit came at the expense of working conditions. Unions were weakened by policies of mitigation and negotiation, and their legal ability to strike was almost entirely removed. To legally strike workers must “exhaust the grievance procedure, then (1) seek official authorization …, (2) win majority support in a bargaining-unit election, (3) post a strike notice, and (4) allow [union] representatives to monitor and mediate the dispute”.[^11] This process was long and ineffective for the redress of workers’ concerns. Despite these setbacks, workers still went on strikes, called “wildcat strikes” to protest working conditions. These strikes were not authorized, nor officially organized by unions. However, they enabled workers, primarily manufacturing workers, to protest and improve their working conditions.[^12]

### 1970s

This decade saw the height of union influence and power. The social movements begun in the 60’s continued, as people protested against discrimination, imperialism, and injustices. The labor movement continued their wildcat strikes and resisted increased automation and output. Stagflation also became a pressing issue at this time, as wages stagnated while prices continued to inflate. To address these issues, union workers attempted to bargain with their employers to raise wages. In California, racetrack workers went on strike after “negotiations broke off … when the federation termed its offer of $2 a day in wage and fringe bene fits ‘final.’ The unions originally sought a package deal the tracks said would cost $6 a day and then dropped their demands to $4”.[^13] The Transit Workers Union faced similart issues and attempted to negotiate a pay raise for its members. They faced great institutional opposition, as the “State Supreme Court Justice George Postel signed an order enjoining the Transport Workers and the Amalgamated Transit Union from striking” and “under the Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees, both unions would be subject to unlimited fines, and individual workers who struck would be subject to probation and the loss of two days' pay for each day they were on strike”.[^14] These institutional setbacks were the result of greater efforts to delegitimize union militancy and increase the power of companies through mediation.



### 1980s

This increase of corporate power became practically insurmountable under the Reagan presidency. To combat stagflation, Reagan began deregulating the economy. He also took an actively anti-union stance. A significant example of this view was the PATCO strike in 1981. PATCO, or the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, wanted higher pay and shorter working hours. When their demands were not met, they went on strike on August 3, 1981. Despite supporting the union during his campaign, Reagan claimed that the strike was illegal and ordered the strikers back to work. When they did not return, he “ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to fire 11,345 strikers and hire replacements”.[^15] On October 23, “the Federal Labor Relations Authority ordered the immediate decertification of Patco … and said the union no longer represented air controllers”.[^16] This prevented these workers from seeking redress of their issues through unionization and removed their ability to organize as a collective. Because the initial strike itself was illegal, PATCO was unable to receive solidarity and aid from other labor unions, “Leaders of other unions say they are hamstrung because Federal laws prohibit secondary boycotts and because the controllers' strike was illegal and thus unions that observed the picket lines might be found in violation of Federal law”.[^17] The enforcement of these anti-union laws put many other labor unions on the defensive, as they were uncertain what actions they could and could not take, both in support of PATCO, and in negotiations for their own members.

The aggressive response to the PATCO strike finalized the federal government’s control over union activities and ushered in a new era of labor opposition through the Taft-Hartley Act. Businesses now understood that President Reagan was willing to punish unions for protesting their conditions. Unions found many of their avenues of change severely limited or cut off completely. Coupled with a strong anti-union sentiment in the public, work force organization declined dramatically.

## Conclusion

The first half of the 20th century was mired by conflict. Various labor movements worked with and against each other attempting to establish and secure better working conditions, while businesses and their CEOs became richer. The World Wars offered opportunity to expand the influence of labor, and to work within the political system to achieve progress. Political parties were created to represent and advocate for the working class, and through this political engagement some changes were made. During the Great Depression, the labor movement was able to secure greater legal standing, as FDR passed policy that prevented businesses from harassing and threatening their employees for engaging with the labor movement, thus following in Theodore Roosevelt’s steps of trust busting and opposing the greater might of monopolies and corporations.

However, labor was not entirely successful, as Red Scares swept the nation and inspired a fear of Socialism, Communism, and organized labor in general. This prevented them from accessing the pollical sphere, and garnering sympathy from the middle class public. Despite these challenges, the labor movement continued to seek more equal and just labor relations in order to promote and protect the individual lives of working class citizens.
