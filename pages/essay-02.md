## Introduction

The Labor movement in the United States is a significant aspect of the cultural revolution that occurred post industrialization. While seeking to shape the paradigm of economics and business that grew out of the late 1800’s, various labor groups appealed to workers and corporations, as well as to the government. These appeals took many forms, most visible were methods of direct action, such as strikes, to secure their various demands. This conflict did not only end with peaceful and beneficial resolutions, as the labor movement was often mired with accusations of communism and fell victim to Red Scares. There were constant fears that organized labor would destroy American society, or that they were conspiring against the nation. 

In attempting to change the economic structure of the United States, and to balance the power of businesses, various labor groups, including unions (both national and local), and various political parties (such as the Socialist and Communist parties), used their public platforms to bring awareness and attention to their causes. Labor unions focused primarily on engaging directly with businesses, striking, quitting, and engaging in discussions to achieve their goals. In response to these challenges, businesses utilized coercive and violent measures to break strikes and prevent unions, while also appealing to the government for aid. In response to this violence, laborers would bomb and destroy property, and some went as far as to try and attack their overseers and bosses. Political parties took these issues to government, challenging standing law, and presenting legal opposition to businesses and the economic structure. They ran candidates, and generated political action, passing new laws, and shifting the political climate to the left. This likewise fueled conflict, as opponents claimed conspiracies and insurgency. Particularly after the Bolshevik Revolution, a fear of communism prevented the welcoming of more progressive laws. However, these fears did not prevent changes from being made, as both major parties adopted parts of these agendas to appeal to a broader constituency. Often violent, and shaped by conflict, the labor movement propelled the adoption of many workplace standards we have today.

### 1900s

The turn of the century saw the rise of industrial capitalism in the United States. So called ‘robber barons’ accumulated wealth through the creation of monopolies in steel, oil, rail, and other industries. Andrew Carnegie, J.D. Rockefeller, Charles Vanderbilt, J.P. Morgan, and others used horizontal and vertical integration to increase their profits and establish monopolies. This accumulation of wealth was not distributed evenly, and created greater social inequality, particularly in centers of industry. 

President McKinley led the nation into this new century, emphasizing republican ideals and advocating for expansionism. He maintained business friendly policies, such as raising the tariff and opposing free silver, a Populist platform. While speaking in Buffalo during the Pan-American Exposition he defended his economic policies claiming that “trade statistics indicate that this country is in a state of unexampled prosperity”[^1]. He was assassinated the next day by an anarchist, causing Theodore Roosevelt to assume the title of President. Roosevelt took a more radical approach to economics, establishing anti-monopoly policies through legal action.

However, this property did not find its way to all citizens, nor did Roosevelt entirely support the working class. Immigrants and racial minorities struggled to achieve the same prosperity as their bourgeoise counterparts, and many industrial workers turned to labor unions to demand better pay and safer work. Notable among these was the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902 in Pennsylvania. They went on strike seeking an 8-hour workday, recognition, and better pay. Business leaders resisted these demands, and the national guard was eventually deployed in an attempt to prevent violence and property damage[^2]. Though Roosevelt was able to achieve a mediated solution and end the strike, labor still had very little power.

### 1910s

The United States entered World War one in 1917, almost 3 years after the conflict began in 1914. Strikes were fairly consistent across the country in the years leading up to American entry, as workers continued to press for better working conditions and pay. However, Wilson sought to avoid domestic conflict in order to present a unified front and increase the efficiency of the war effort. To this end, he collaborated with Samuel Gompers, the head of the American Federation of Labor, to acquiesce on labor demands to guarantee that affiliated unions would not strike for the duration of the war. He called on workers to “to see to it that the spirit and methods of democracy are maintained within our own country” as the US fought autocracy abroad and asserted that “labor has a further interest in the war. This war is a people's war, labor's war. The final outcome will be determined in the factories, the mills, the shops, the mines, the farms, the industries and the transportation agencies of the various countries”[^3]. 

These views were not shared by the whole labor movement, and many other prominent leaders spoke for peace and against American involvement. Eugene Debs, a renowned socialist decried the war. In June of 1918 he spoke to an assembly in Canton, Ohio. He was aware that criticizing the war would be seen as sedition and was later jailed for his statements. In this speech, he challenged the justice of the war, for it is “the working class who fight all the battles, the working class who make the supreme sacrifices, the working class who freely shed their blood and furnish the corpses, have never yet had a voice in either declaring war or making peace. It is the ruling class that invariably does both. They alone declare war and they alone make peace”[^4]. He knew the working class held no power, and that in a state of war they were the victims of the whims of the powerful. The sacrifices made to allow the war effort to succeed were invariably made by the poor, and he called attention to their struggles and to their victimhood in war.

### 1920s

The post-war decade was a time of great social change and prosperity. More and more, the middle and working class were able to access the benefits of industrialization, acquiring electricity, running water, and automobiles. Still however, the benefits of this increased wealth were unevenly distributed. Inequities continued, particularly in urban areas, where there was a large immigrant population. A greater focus was put on the quality of life, and a renewed focus was put on factory and child labor. Many families required young children to work, either on the streets, in factories, or at home to make money to provide basic necessities.

However, for the labor movement, this was a time of great struggle. The end of World War One brought about a Red Scare, as Americans became increasingly paranoid that Socialists and Communists, or “Bolsheviks” were attempting to coup American institutions. This sentiment brought about a hostile response to the demands of labor, exemplified very clearly through the Battle of Blair Mountain in West Virginia. Miners in Logan County took up arms to protest their treatment by mining companies, the end result of many years of abuse and disputes between the Mining Union and local companies. In response to the miner’s aggression, President Harding declared a state of emergency and sent in the US Army to break the strike[^6]. Roughly 10,000 miners died in the conflict, and none of the union demands were met.

### 1930s

The Great Depression, begun in 1929 with the Stock Market Crash, ushered in an era of economic upheaval. Unemployment skyrocketed as businesses were forced to lay off employees and shut down. A run on the banks in the early years of the depression likewise increased hardships, as banks closed, and people lost their life savings. Hoover’s laissez faire approach to the crisis, refusing to leave the gold standard and introducing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff to try and protect American industry, deepened the crisis by limiting the economic ability of both businesses and banks. 

In 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president. Under his administration, labor unions received legal protections, first under the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933, “employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives”[^7] then when that was ruled illegal, under the Wagner Act in 1935, “Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection”[^8]. These two laws enabled workers to gain access to unions at a higher rate and increased the influence of the labor movement in the economic sphere.

### 1940s
FDR had introduced many policies during the Depression to alleviate economic struggles, and though modestly successful, was unable to fully recover the American economy. With the outbreak of another war in Europe in 1939 when Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, America was uniquely situated to profit from the conflict. FDR remained tacitly neutral, while offering financial support and older military equipment to the United Kingdom. FDR also worked to improve American military capacity. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, HI, the nation was able to respond quickly and establish a military-industrial complex to generate economic output to supply the war effort in the Pacific and European Theaters. 

This new military-industrial complex, as well as the institution of a draft, opened new economic opportunities for women. Because industrial labor had been a male dominated field, the political parties and labor unions representing and advocating for these workers often ignored women’s issues. The reduction of white men also allowed for the African American community to take a more prominent role in society, moving northward and into urban areas, and demanding more vocally equal rights and the end to Jim Crow. These two groups had been isolated from the labor movement, but were now prominent and necessary components of industry, staking claims for themselves as equal members of society.

## Conclusion

The first half of the 20th century was mired by conflict. Various labor movements worked with and against each other attempting to establish and secure better working conditions, while businesses and their CEOs became richer. The World Wars offered opportunity to expand the influence of labor, and to work within the political system to achieve progress. Political parties were created to represent and advocate for the working class, and through this political engagement some changes were made. During the Great Depression, the labor movement was able to secure greater legal standing, as FDR passed policy that prevented businesses from harassing and threatening their employees for engaging with the labor movement, thus following in Theodore Roosevelt’s steps of trust busting and opposing the greater might of monopolies and corporations.

However, labor was not entirely successful, as Red Scares swept the nation and inspired a fear of Socialism, Communism, and organized labor in general. This prevented them from accessing the pollical sphere, and garnering sympathy from the middle class public. Despite these challenges, the labor movement continued to seek more equal and just labor relations in order to promote and protect the individual lives of working class citizens.
